## Listing Integrations

List all connected social media accounts to get their IDs:

```bash
postiz integrations:list
```

This returns a JSON array of integrations. Use `jq` to extract specific fields:

```bash
# Get just the IDs and platform names
postiz integrations:list | jq '.[] | {id, identifier}'
```

```bash
# Find a specific platform
postiz integrations:list | jq '.[] | select(.identifier=="reddit")'
```

## Getting Settings

Each platform has its own settings schema with character limits, required fields, and available options. Retrieve it with:

```bash
postiz integrations:settings <integration-id>
```

The response tells you:
- What fields are available (title, privacy level, subreddit, etc.)
- Which fields are required
- Character limits and validation rules
- Available dynamic tools you can trigger

<Tip>
Always check `integrations:settings` before posting to a new platform to understand what settings are available.
</Tip>

## Triggering Tools

Some platforms expose dynamic tools — for example, fetching Reddit flairs, YouTube playlists, or LinkedIn company pages. These return data you need when constructing platform-specific settings.

```bash
postiz integrations:trigger <integration-id> <method-name>
```

Pass additional data with `-d`:

```bash
postiz integrations:trigger <integration-id> <method-name> -d '{"key":"value"}'
```

### Examples

**Get Reddit flairs for a subreddit:**
```bash
postiz integrations:trigger reddit-id getFlairs -d '{"subreddit":"programming"}'
```

**Get YouTube playlists:**
```bash
postiz integrations:trigger youtube-id getPlaylists
```

**Get LinkedIn company pages:**
```bash
postiz integrations:trigger linkedin-id getCompanies
```

**Get Pinterest boards:**
```bash
postiz integrations:trigger pinterest-id getBoards
```

## Discovery Workflow

When working with a new platform, follow this workflow:

```bash
# 1. Find the integration ID
INTEGRATION_ID=$(postiz integrations:list | jq -r '.[] | select(.identifier=="reddit") | .id')

# 2. Check what settings and tools are available
postiz integrations:settings "$INTEGRATION_ID"

# 3. Use tools to fetch dynamic data (e.g., flairs)
postiz integrations:trigger "$INTEGRATION_ID" getFlairs -d '{"subreddit":"programming"}'

# 4. Create a post with the discovered settings
postiz posts:create \
  -c "My post" \
  -s "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z" \
  --settings '{"subreddit":[{"value":{"subreddit":"programming","title":"Post Title","type":"text"}}]}' \
  -i "$INTEGRATION_ID"
```
