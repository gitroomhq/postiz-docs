---

The Postiz CLI is a command-line tool for automating social media posting across 28+ platforms. It wraps the [Public API](/public-api/introduction) so you can schedule posts, manage integrations, and upload media directly from your terminal or shell scripts.

## Installation

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install -g postiz
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm install -g postiz
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Verify the installation:

```bash
postiz --help
```

## Setup

### API Key

Set your Postiz API key as an environment variable. You can get your API key from the Postiz Settings page.

```bash
export POSTIZ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

<Tip>
Add this to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.) so it persists across sessions.
</Tip>

### Custom API URL (self-hosted)

If you're running a self-hosted Postiz instance, point the CLI to your server:

```bash
export POSTIZ_API_URL=https://your-postiz-server.com
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. List your connected social media accounts
postiz integrations:list

# 2. Create a scheduled post
postiz posts:create \
  -c "Hello from the Postiz CLI!" \
  -s "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z" \
  -i "your-integration-id"

# 3. List your scheduled posts
postiz posts:list
```
