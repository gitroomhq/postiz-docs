## Creating Posts

Use `posts:create` to schedule or draft posts to one or more platforms.

### Simple Post

```bash
postiz posts:create \
  -c "Hello world!" \
  -s "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z" \
  -i "your-integration-id"
```

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-c, --content` | Post content. Use multiple times for threads/comments. |
| `-s, --date` | Schedule date in ISO 8601 format (required) |
| `-t, --type` | `schedule` (default) or `draft` |
| `-m, --media` | Comma-separated media URLs (use after uploading) |
| `-i, --integrations` | Comma-separated integration IDs (required) |
| `-d, --delay` | Delay between comments in milliseconds (default: 5000) |
| `--settings` | Platform-specific settings as JSON |
| `-j, --json` | Path to a JSON file for complex posts |

### Draft Post

```bash
postiz posts:create \
  -c "Review this before publishing" \
  -s "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z" \
  -t draft \
  -i "your-integration-id"
```

### Post with Media

Upload your media first with the [`upload`](/cli/media-upload) command, then reference the returned URL:

```bash
postiz posts:create \
  -c "Check out this photo!" \
  -m "https://uploads.postiz.com/your-image.jpg" \
  -s "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z" \
  -i "your-integration-id"
```

### Threads and Comments

Pass `-c` multiple times to create a thread. Each comment can have its own media with a corresponding `-m` flag:

```bash
postiz posts:create \
  -c "Thread 1/3" -m "image1.jpg" \
  -c "Thread 2/3" -m "image2.jpg" \
  -c "Thread 3/3" \
  -s "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z" \
  -i "twitter-integration-id"
```

Use `-d` to control the delay between comments (in milliseconds):

```bash
postiz posts:create \
  -c "First tweet" \
  -c "Second tweet" \
  -c "Third tweet" \
  -s "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z" \
  -d 2000 \
  -i "twitter-integration-id"
```

### Multi-Platform Post

Send the same content to multiple platforms by passing comma-separated integration IDs:

```bash
postiz posts:create \
  -c "Posting everywhere!" \
  -s "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z" \
  -i "twitter-id,linkedin-id,facebook-id"
```

### Platform-Specific Settings

Some platforms require additional settings. Pass them as JSON with `--settings`:

```bash
postiz posts:create \
  -c "Check out this discussion" \
  -s "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z" \
  --settings '{"subreddit":[{"value":{"subreddit":"programming","title":"My Post","type":"text"}}]}' \
  -i "reddit-integration-id"
```

<Tip>
Use `postiz integrations:settings <id>` to discover what settings are available for each platform. See [Integrations](/cli/integrations) for details.
</Tip>

### Complex Posts with JSON

For posts with detailed platform-specific content, use a JSON file:

```bash
postiz posts:create --json post.json
```

Example `post.json`:

```json
{
  "integrations": ["twitter-123", "linkedin-456"],
  "posts": [
    {
      "provider": "twitter",
      "post": [{ "content": "Short tweet version", "image": [] }]
    },
    {
      "provider": "linkedin",
      "post": [{ "content": "Longer LinkedIn version with more detail", "image": [] }],
      "settings": { "__type": "linkedin" }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Listing Posts

```bash
postiz posts:list
```

### Filter by Date Range

```bash
postiz posts:list \
  --startDate "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z" \
  --endDate "2025-01-31T23:59:59Z"
```

### Filter by Customer

```bash
postiz posts:list --customer "customer-id"
```

## Connecting Missing Posts

Some platforms don't return a post ID immediately after publishing (the `releaseId` is set to `"missing"`). When this happens, you can fetch recent content from the provider and connect the correct one to your post. This enables analytics tracking.

### List Available Content

```bash
postiz posts:missing <post-id>
```

Returns an array of recent content items from the provider with their ID and thumbnail URL:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "7321456789012345678",
    "url": "https://p16-sign.tiktokcdn-us.com/obj/cover-image.jpeg"
  },
  {
    "id": "7321456789012345679",
    "url": "https://p16-sign.tiktokcdn-us.com/obj/cover-image2.jpeg"
  }
]
```

<Note>
This only works for posts where the `releaseId` is `"missing"`. Returns an empty array if the provider doesn't support this feature.
</Note>

### Connect a Post

Once you've identified the correct content, update the release ID:

```bash
postiz posts:connect <post-id> --release-id "7321456789012345678"
```

After connecting, the post will support full analytics via `postiz analytics:post`.

### Full Workflow

```bash
# 1. Find posts with missing release IDs
postiz posts:list | jq '.posts[] | select(.releaseId == "missing") | {id, content}'

# 2. Get available content from the provider
postiz posts:missing <post-id>

# 3. Connect the correct content
postiz posts:connect <post-id> --release-id "7321456789012345678"

# 4. Verify analytics now work
postiz analytics:post <post-id>
```

## Deleting Posts

```bash
postiz posts:delete <post-id>
```
