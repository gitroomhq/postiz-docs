Some platforms (like Skool) do not offer public OAuth APIs. Postiz connects to these platforms using a browser extension that securely extracts session cookies from your browser.

## How It Works

1. You install the Postiz Chrome Extension in your browser.
2. When adding a cookie-based channel, the extension reads your session cookies for that platform.
3. The cookies are sent to your Postiz backend and stored securely as an encrypted JWT.
4. The extension automatically refreshes cookies every 24 hours to keep connections alive.

<Warning>
Using cookies to interact with platforms may violate their terms of service. Use this feature at your own risk.

## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the Extension">
    Install the Postiz browser extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/postiz/cidhffagahknaeodkplfbcpfeielnkjl?hl=en).

    Alternatively, for self-hosted setups, you can build the extension from source:

    ```bash
    cd apps/extension
    pnpm build
    ```

    Then load the `apps/extension/dist` folder as an unpacked extension in Chrome:
    1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
    2. Enable **Developer mode** (top right toggle)
    3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `dist` folder
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get the Extension ID">
    After installing the extension, you need its **Extension ID**:

    1. Go to `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome
    2. Find the **Postiz** extension
    3. Copy the **ID** shown under the extension name (e.g., `cidhffagahknaeodkplfbcpfeielnkjl`)

    If you installed from the Chrome Web Store, the ID is: `cidhffagahknaeodkplfbcpfeielnkjl`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the Environment Variable">
    Add the extension ID to your Postiz environment variables:

    ```env
    EXTENSION_ID="cidhffagahknaeodkplfbcpfeielnkjl"
    ```

    Restart Postiz after setting this variable.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Supported Platforms

The following platforms use the Chrome Extension for authentication:

  <Card title="Skool" icon="graduation-cap" href="/providers/skool">
    Post to Skool communities
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Self-Hosted Considerations

If you are self-hosting Postiz on a domain other than `localhost` or `*.postiz.com`, you need to build a custom extension with your domain in the `externally_connectable` manifest field.

Edit `apps/extension/manifest.json` and add your domain:

```json
{
  "externally_connectable": {
    "matches": [
      "http://localhost/*",
      "https://localhost/*",
      "https://*.postiz.com/*",
      "https://your-domain.com/*"
    ]
  }
}
```

Then rebuild the extension and load it as an unpacked extension in Chrome.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Extension not found"** — Make sure the `EXTENSION_ID` environment variable is set and Postiz has been restarted.
- **"Extension not reachable"** — The extension may be disabled. Check `chrome://extensions/` and make sure Postiz is enabled.
- **"Could not get cookies"** — You must be logged in to the platform in the same Chrome browser where the extension is installed.
- **Cookies expire** — The extension automatically refreshes cookies every 24 hours. If a connection drops, try reconnecting the channel.
