## The Helm Chart

Postiz has a helm chart that is in very active development. You can find it here;

Note that this is a OCI compliant helm chart, meaning that you don't do `helm repo add`, and if you are using Flux or Helm, you must set them to OCI mode.

The `values.yml` file can be found in the repository, or a direct link to it is: [https://github.com/gitroomhq/postiz-helmchart/blob/main/charts/postiz/values.yaml](https://github.com/gitroomhq/postiz-helmchart/blob/main/charts/postiz/values.yaml)
