You can see all the providers that Postiz supports documented in the sidebar, under "**Providers Configuration**".

Please note that no providers are configured by default. You will need to configure them all in your `.env` file, or as environment variables. You will need to restart Postiz whenever you change environment variables. If you are using docker compose, you must run `docker compose down` and then docker compose `up` to rebuild the containers with the updated variables.
