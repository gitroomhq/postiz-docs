## Connection Options
There are two ways to connect to an Instagram account: by using a Facebook Business or through a standalone flow that connects directly to an Instagram account. Both methods will require a [Meta for Developpers account](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/).

## Setting up Meta Application

The following steps will guide you through the setup of a Meta application that can be used for connecting Instagram to Postiz.

<Steps>
### Step 1
Select a business portfolio, then create a [new app in Meta for developers](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/creation/).<br />
Please be advised that for public applications, you will need to verify your business.
