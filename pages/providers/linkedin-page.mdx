Verify your app with LinkedIn

You will need to follow the verification process to request the necessary permissions listed below. 

Fill in all the details, once created head over to Products and make sure you add all the required products:
- Share on LinkedIn
- Advertising API
- Signin with LinkedIn using OpenID connect

It is important to request the Advertising API permissions and fill up the request form, or you will not have the ability to refresh your tokens.

<OAuth2Redirect provider = "linkedin-page" />


Copy the created `Client ID` and `Client Secret` and add them to your `.env` file.

```env
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID=""
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET=""
```
You can find those under the Auth Tab of your LinkedIn App in the developer portal.
