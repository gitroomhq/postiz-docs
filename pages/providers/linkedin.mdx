It is important to request the Advertising API permissions and fill up the request form, or you will not have the ability to refresh your tokens.

<OAuth2Redirect provider = "linkedin" />

If you are using the "LinkedIN Page" provider, then the redirect url should be "linkedin-page".

Copy the created `Client ID` and `Client Secret` and add them to your `.env` file.

```env
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID=""
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET=""
```
You can find those under the Auth Tab of your LinkedIn App in the developer portal.
