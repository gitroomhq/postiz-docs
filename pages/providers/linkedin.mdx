<NeverShare />

Head over to [Linkedin developers](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps) and create a new app.

Fill in all the details, once created head over to Products and make sure you add all the required products:

- Share on LinkedIn
- Advertising API
- Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect

It is important to request the Advertising API permissions and fill out the request form, or you will not have the ability to refresh your tokens.

Have all of your information ready as the Advertising API request form asks quite a few questions about your business and use-case. Make sure to mention that your app is *not* being used to collect "member data". This will greatly increase your chances of being accepted. You can read more about the process [here](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a527289).

<OAuth2Redirect provider = "linkedin" />

If you are using the "LinkedIn Page" provider, then the redirect url should be "linkedin-page".

Copy the created `Client ID` and `Client Secret` and add them to your `.env` file.

```env
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID=""
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET=""
```
You can find these IDs under the Auth Tab of your LinkedIn App in the developer portal.
