  <Step title="Create a Bot">
    Navigate to the "Bot" section of the Discord Developer Portal. Fill out the bot details however you like, and then click "Reset Token".

    With the token that is generated, set it in your .env file as follows;

```env
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_ID="your_bot_token"
```

    If you do not set this, you will get 404 errors when trying to add the Discord channel in the Postiz web interface.

    Stop Postiz if it is running, and then start it using the .env file with the Discord details.
