<Note>
This integration requires that you have a TikTok developer account. It also requires that you have a public website, with https, and can upload files to that site to verify ownership.

TikTok will also not allow http:// for your app redirect URI, so you will need to be accessing Postiz from HTTPS.
</Note>

<Warning>
**NOTE:** TikTok fetches media via pull_from_url. Your media files must be publicly reachable over HTTPS; localhost or private routes (e.g., /uploads) will fail. 
Expose your uploads via a reverse proxy (e.g., [Caddy](/reverse-proxies/caddy)) or use object storage/CDN such as [Cloudflare R2](/configuration/r2) with public access.

Ensure the media domain is listed under your TikTok developer account's verified sites.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your app">
    Go here: [https://developers.tiktok.com/apps](https://developers.tiktok.com/apps)

    ![Create a new app](/images/providers/tiktok/tiktok_create_app.png)

    Replace `{provider}` with `tiktok` in the redirect URI.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set a TOS and Privacy Policy">
    This needs to be on a public domain that you have access to, that is hosted on HTTPS. 

    Tick "Web" for your platforms.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add apps">
    Add the "Login Kit" and "Content Posting API" to your app.

    For "Login Kit", set the redirect URI to http://localhost:4200/integrations/social/tiktok

    For Content posting API, enable "Direct Post".
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add scopes">
    Add the following scopes:
    - user.info.basic
    - video.create
    - video.publish
    - video.upload
    - user.info.profile
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy your client secret to environment variables">
    These can be found immediately after registering your application. The client ID is 16 characters long and the secret is 32 characters long.

```env
TIKTOK_CLIENT_ID=1234567890123456
TIKTOK_CLIENT_SECRET=12345678901234567890123456789012

  <Step title="Add a TikTok channel in the Postiz web interface">
