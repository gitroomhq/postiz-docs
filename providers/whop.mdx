<Note>
This integration requires that you have a [Whop](https://whop.com) account with at least one company and a forum experience set up.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Whop OAuth Application">
    Go to the [Whop Developer Portal](https://dash.whop.com/settings/developer) and create a new application.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get and set your Client ID">
    Copy the **Client ID** from your Whop application settings and add it to your `.env` file:

```env
WHOP_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id"
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a Redirect URI">
    <Snippet file="oauth2redirect.mdx" />

    **Your Whop OAuth2 Redirect URI:**
    - Production: `https://your-postiz-domain.com/integrations/social/whop`
    - Local development: `http://localhost:4200/integrations/social/whop`
    - Docker: `http://localhost:5000/integrations/social/whop`

    Add this redirect URI in your Whop application settings.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Whop as a Channel in Postiz">
    Go to the Postiz web interface, click **Add Channel**, and select **Whop**. You will be redirected to Whop to authorize the connection.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Post">
    When creating a post for Whop, you will need to configure:

    - **Company** — Select which Whop company to post under.
    - **Forum** — Select the forum (experience) to post in.
    - **Title** — An optional title for your forum post.

    The post content supports **Markdown** formatting. You can also attach files to your post.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Features

- **Post to forums** — Publish posts to any Whop forum you have access to.
- **Markdown support** — Write posts using full Markdown formatting.
- **Comments** — Schedule threaded comments on your posts.
- **File attachments** — Attach images and files to posts and comments.
- **Token refresh** — Postiz automatically refreshes your Whop access token to keep the connection alive.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Invalid token, please re-authenticate"** — Your access token has expired or been revoked. Reconnect the integration by removing and re-adding the Whop channel.
- **"Insufficient permissions"** — Your Whop account may not have the required scopes. Re-authenticate to grant the necessary permissions.
- **"Forum or experience not found"** — The selected forum may have been deleted or you no longer have access to it. Select a different forum.
- **No companies appear** — Make sure your Whop account owns or manages at least one company.
- **No forums appear** — The selected company must have at least one forum experience created. Set up a forum in your Whop company dashboard first.
