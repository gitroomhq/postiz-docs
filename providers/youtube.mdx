## Additional Steps for Brand Accounts

<Note>
When using a Brand account you will need to set your APP to External and setup a test user. You do not need to publish the APP, but it does take time for the changes to propagate. You will also need to add the app to the trusted apps within your google workspace Admin.

  <Step title="Go to admin.google.com">
    Sign in
  </Step>

  <Step title="Go to Security Settings">
    Go to Security → Access and data Controls → API Controls
    Click Manage Third Party App Access
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure new App">
    Click "Configure new App"
    Put your Client ID for the app you created in previous steps into the search box and select your app
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set scopes and Google Data Access">
    Set scopes and Google Data Access for the app to Trusted
    Once set, click save
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for propagation">
    Wait at least 5 hours for the changes to propagate.
    After this time you should now be able to add your YouTube channel to your Postiz account
