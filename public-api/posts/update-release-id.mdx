## Endpoint

`PUT /public/v1/posts/{id}/release-id`

## Description

Updates the `releaseId` of a post that currently has its release ID set to `"missing"`. This connects the post to its actual published content on the platform, enabling analytics and statistics tracking.

This is typically used after calling the [Get Missing Content](/public-api/posts/missing-content) endpoint to retrieve the list of available content items.

## Headers

| Header | Type | Required | Description |
|--------|------|----------|-------------|
| `Authorization` | string | Yes | Your organization API key |
| `Content-Type` | string | Yes | `application/json` |

## Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Yes | The post ID |

## Request Body

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `releaseId` | string | Yes | The platform-specific content ID to connect to this post |

```json
{
  "releaseId": "7321456789012345678"
}
```

<Note>
The post must have its current `releaseId` set to `"missing"` for this endpoint to work. Posts with a `null` or already-set release ID cannot be updated through this endpoint.
</Note>

## Example

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://your-postiz-instance.com/public/v1/posts/clx123abc/release-id" \
  -H "Authorization: your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"releaseId": "7321456789012345678"}'
```

## Full Workflow

1. Identify posts with `releaseId` set to `"missing"` (via the [List Posts](/public-api/posts/list) endpoint)
2. Fetch available content from the provider using [Get Missing Content](/public-api/posts/missing-content)
3. Match the correct content item and update using this endpoint
4. The post will now support full analytics via the [Post Analytics](/public-api/analytics/post) endpoint
